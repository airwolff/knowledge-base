  - name: "Best Practices (Do's)"
    description:
      - "Explicitly specify the desired output format, such as JSON, Markdown, CSV, or a bulleted list."
      - "Provide few-shot examples that demonstrate the exact output structure you require."
      - "When requesting JSON, provide a schema or a clear example of the object structure."
  - name: "Common Pitfalls (Don'ts)"
    description:
      - "Do not assume the model will guess the correct format; without explicit instructions, the output will likely be unstructured prose."
      - "Don't just describe the format; show it with an example."
