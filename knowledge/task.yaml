entry_name: Task
type:
  - Prompt Engineering
  - Core Prompt Component
description: How can you clearly define the specific action or goal you want the AI model to perform, ensuring it includes a strong verb or command for a focused and actionable response?
core_components:
  - name: "Best Practices (Do's)"
    description:
      - Place the primary instruction at the beginning of the prompt to anchor the model's attention.
      - Use clear, direct, and unambiguous action verbs to specify the task (e.g., 'Summarize', 'Generate', 'Classify').
      - For complex tasks, distinguish between the high-level 'Objective' and the specific 'Instructions'.
      - Split up complex tasks into smaller, simpler subtasks or a numbered list of steps.
  - name: "Common Pitfalls (Don'ts)"
    description:
      - Avoid burying the main directive after large blocks of context.
      - Do not be vague or ambiguous; the model cannot read your mind.
      - Avoid cramming multiple topics or data sources into a single prompt.
mechanism_and_use:
  - name: "Effective Application (Good Examples)"
    description:
      - "Summarize the text below as a bullet point list of the most important points. Text: \"\"\" {text input here} \"\"\"."
      - "Your objective is to help students with math problems without directly giving them the answer. Instructions: 1. Understand what the problem is asking. 2. Provide a hint for the next step."
  - name: "Ineffective Application (Bad Examples)"
    description:
      - "Here is some text. Please do something with it. {text input here}."
      - "How can I improve my business?"
connections_and_applications:
  description: "The Task component is the engine of the prompt, defining the verb or action the AI must take. It works directly with Context (what to act on) and Format (how to present the result)."

simple_explanation: >
  The Task is telling the AI exactly what to do. If the AI is a chef, the task isn't "food," it's "chop these onions into a fine dice." It's the specific verb or command.
