# Description: This file contains the knowledge base for the "Constraints" prompt component. It is used by the Prompt Architect to guide users in setting rules and boundaries for an AI's output.

entry_name: Constraints
type:
  - Prompt Engineering
  - Core Prompt Component
description: What specific rules, boundaries, or limitations should the AI adhere to in its response to ensure it is safe, compliant, and meets your exact requirements?
core_components:
  - name: "Best Practices (Do's)"
    description:
      - "Frame constraints as positive, affirmative directives. Tell the model what to do instead of what not to do."
      - "When a negative instruction is unavoidable, pair it with a positive alternative."
      - "Be explicit and quantitative with constraints, especially for length (e.g., 'Summarize in under 100 words')."
  - name: "Common Pitfalls (Don'ts)"
    description:
      - "Rely heavily on negative constraints like 'DO NOT...'. Models can struggle to process negations."
      - "Use vague constraints like 'fairly short' or 'not too long'."
      - "Do not assume the model will infer constraints from the context."
mechanism_and_use:
  - name: "Effective Application (Good Examples)"
    description:
      - "Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never use ellipses."
      - "Write a summary in under 100 words with exactly three exclamation points."
  - name: "Ineffective Application (Bad Examples)"
    description:
      - "The description for this product should be fairly short, a few sentences only, and not too much more."
      - "DO NOT ASK USERNAME OR PASSWORD."
connections_and_applications:
  description: "Constraints are the guardrails for the Task. They define the boundaries, rules, and limitations of the output, ensuring it stays focused and meets specific requirements like length or tone."

      details: "'Write an email to the team. The email must be under 75 words.' The word count is a clear constraint."
simple_explanation: >
  Constraints are the rules of the game. If you're playing charades, the constraint is "you can't talk." For an AI, a constraint might be "write a story that is exactly 50 words long" or "only use words that start with the letter P."
