core_components:
  - name: "Best Practices (Do's)"
    description:
      - "Assign a specific, expert persona to elicit more detailed and accurate responses (e.g., 'Act as a senior software architect')."
      - "Use descriptive adjectives to explicitly define the desired tone (e.g., 'formal', 'humorous')."
      - "Define the target audience to help the AI tailor its tone, content, and style."
  - name: "Common Pitfalls (Don'ts)"
    description:
      - "Avoid generic prompts without a persona when seeking expert-level content."

mechanism_and_use:
  - name: "Effective Application (Good Examples)"
    description:
      - "You are a tech educator who specializes in explaining complex topics in simple, relatable language. Write a 500-word blog post explaining what blockchain is."
      - "Give me three responses to this problem: one from a philosopher, one from an engineer, and one from a stand-up comedian."
  - name: "Ineffective Application (Bad Examples)"
    description:
      - "Explain blockchain."
      - "Act as an expert."

      details: "'Act as a senior copywriter for a luxury brand. Your tone should be elegant and aspirational.' This persona dictates the style of the output."
simple_explanation: >
  The Persona is like giving the AI a costume and a character to play. Instead of a generic robot voice, you might ask it to be a pirate, a scientist, or a friendly teacher. The answer it gives will be in that character's style.
