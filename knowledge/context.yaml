entry_name: Context
type:
  - Prompt Engineering
  - Core Prompt Component
description: What essential background information, reference text, or specific data should the AI be aware of to accurately address your request and prevent factual errors?
core_components:
  - name: "Best Practices (Do's)"
    description:
      - "Provide explicit reference text whenever the task requires proprietary or recent information to prevent hallucination."
      - "Use clear delimiters (e.g., ###, <context>) to sharply distinguish between instructions and reference text."
      - "Ensure the provided context is accurate and relevant. The principle of 'garbage in, garbage out' applies."
  - name: "Common Pitfalls (Don'ts)"
    description:
      - "Do not ask the model to perform tasks based on information it couldn't possibly know without providing that information."
      - "Avoid overloading the prompt with irrelevant information that could confuse the model."
mechanism_and_use:
  - name: "Effective Application (Good Examples)"
    description:
      - "Answer the question based on the context below. Respond 'Unsure about answer' if the information is not present. Context: ### [Paste article here] ### Question: What was the primary finding?"
      - "Based on the attached financial report, analyze the company's profitability over the past five years."
  - name: "Ineffective Application (Bad Examples)"
    description:
      - "Analyze our company's profitability over the past five years."
      - "[Pasting entire codebase] Help me with my Python code."
connections_and_applications:
  description: "Context provides the 'grounding truth' for the Task. It is the information, data, or source text that the AI must operate on."

simple_explanation: >
  If you ask the AI to summarize a book, the Context is the book itself. You have to give it the information it needs to work with, otherwise it's just guessing.
